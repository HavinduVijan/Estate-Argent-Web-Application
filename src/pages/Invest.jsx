          "Buying property in a developed country like the USA is very exciting and potentially it could be a great investment. But it could also be tricky and unfortunately sometimes very unpleasant surprises happened (false deeds/titles, wrong verification, boundary disputesâ€¦) We have already bought three properties in USA using SalesFirst as our agents and we are very happy to recommend them based on the excellent service they have always provided us with." - John D. - CEO, ABC Investments
